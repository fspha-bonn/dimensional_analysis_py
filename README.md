# Dimensional analysis

Dimensional analysis is the method of deriving possible equations by analyzing the units of the relevant variables and combining them for the desired output.

## SI-Units

The international system of units measures 7 units from which all other units can be constructed.

Quantity | Unit |
---------|------
Time     | sec
Distance | m
Mass     | kg
Current  | A
Heat     | K
Amount   | mol
Luminousity | cd

By ordering this list and interpreting the powers on each unit as a vector in 7-dimensional Unit-Space we can calculate the powers of each variable.
