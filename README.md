# Dimensional analysis

Dimensional analysis is the method of deriving possible equations by analyzing the units of the relevant variables and combining them for the desired output.

## SI-Units

The international system of units measures 7 units from which all other units can be constructed.

Quantity | Unit | Index in vector
---------|------|----------------
Time     | s    | 0
Distance | m    | 1
Mass     | kg   | 2
Current  | A    | 3
Heat     | K    | 4
Amount   | mol  | 5
Luminousity | cd | 6

By ordering this list and interpreting the powers on each unit as a vector in 7-dimensional Unit-Space we can calculate the powers of each variable.
